New Tab is a simple chrome extension, built with the focus of centering all in one place, a place where you set your goals, your tasks and with a bit of existencialism. Due to allowing the user have a timer, this timer, will give you an approximation of how much time you have left in this earth.

And how much time you have left of being productive, just to feel a bit the pressure.

## Installation

Before we can initialize this project, make sure to download the dependencies after cloning this repository in your local machine.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EmilioBlacksmith/newTab-Productivity.git
```

then:

```bash
  cd /newTab-Productivity
```

## Deployment

**!!! - TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS PROJECT YOU WILL NEED TO GET AN ACCOUNT FOR UNSPLASH API.**

Once you do have a unsplash account to get the unplash api access key, all you have to do, to build this project, is to:

```bash
  npm run build
```

When you run that, the terminal is going to ask you for an access key:

```bash
No existing Unsplash API access key found. Please provide one.

Please enter your Unsplash API access key:

```

You neet to input your Unsplash API Access Key. Once you copy and paste that api key in the terminal, you will build the project, in a folder named `/dist`.

Now everytime you call the npm run build, if you make any changes, it will get the .env, and you will not need to re-enter your api keys.
